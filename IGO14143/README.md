# HPCS_LUAD
Part of the code base for analysis of the high-plasticity cell state in lung adenocarcinoma study by Chan*, Pan* et. al. 

## Processing of 10x single cell mRNA sequencing data generated from tumors below.  Cells were hashed using mouse TotalSeq B hashes as per Stoeckius et al., Genome Biology, 2018.

_IGO14143.ipynb_ - Jupyter notebook to process KPfrt Slc4a11-MCD/+ Hip11-GGCB/+ tumors harvested 16 weeks post tumor induction after 2 weeks of tracing induction with Tamoxifen. Used to generate Figure 1h.
