Part of the code base for analysis of the high-plasticity cell state in lung adenocarcinoma study by Chan*, Pan* et. al. 

## Processing of 10x single cell mRNA sequencing data generated from tumors below.  Cells were hashed using mouse TotalSeq B hashes as per Stoeckius et al., Genome Biology, 2018.

_IGO16235.ipynb_ - Jupyter notebook to process KPfrt Slc4a11-MCD/+ Rosa26-mTmG/+ tumors harvested 17 weeks post tumor induction after 3 weeks of lineage tracing post Tamoxifen under therapeutic pressure with either vehicle, cisplatin, or MRTX1133.
